		<h1>Philosophers Dining Problem</h1>
		<p>
			In this project from 42 Quebec, we are managing threads 
			(Philosophers) trying to access mutexes (Forks) 
			so that they can eat before they die of hunger.
			</br>
			To use to program: 
			</br>
			<code>make all</code>
			</br>
			<code>./philo ARG1 ARG2 ARG3 ARG4 (opt.) ARG5</code>
			</br>
			ARG1 : Number of philosophers (Threads)
			ARG2 : Time in ms before Philosophers die.
			ARG3 : Time in ms that it takes for a philosopher to eat.
			ARG4 : Time in ms that it takes for a philosopher to sleep.
			ARG5 (Optional) : Number of times a philosopher must eat before he is done.
